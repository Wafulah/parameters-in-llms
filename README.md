# Understanding Weights and Biases in Large Language Models (LLMs)

This Python script provides a clear and illustrative explanation of how weights and biases work in LLMs. It demonstrates how the model predicts the next word in a sequence by adjusting the importance (weight) of words and applying biases to nudge predictions towards reasonable values.

## Key Concepts

**Weights:** In the context of LLMs, weights represent the **importance** or **priority** assigned to each word within the model's vocabulary. Words that frequently appear together in training data typically have higher weights, indicating their stronger influence on predictions.

**Biases:** Biases act as **adjustments** to the output values of the model. They help maintain relevant and meaningful predictions by avoiding extreme or nonsensical results. For example, a bias might be applied to prevent the model from suggesting a word with a very high weight if it's completely out of context in the current sentence.

## Running the Code

### Prerequisites

*   Git: To clone the repository. Install it following the instructions for your operating system.
*   Python 3: You can download and install Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   pip: The package manager for installing Python libraries. You can usually install it with Python.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Wafulah/parameters-in-llms.git](https://github.com/Wafulah/parameters-in-llms.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd parameters-in-llms
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```

4.  **Run the Script:**

    ```bash
    python parameters-explained.py
    ```

## Understanding the Script

The script defines a set of words, including both relevant and irrelevant terms (e.g., "chicken," "banking," "Ronaldo"). It then assigns weights to these words based on their importance in a context. Next, it applies biases to fine-tune the predictions and control how the model handles words with low relevance. Finally, it generates a simple sentence to demonstrate how the model predicts the next word by considering both the weights and biases.

## Feel free to experiment!

Explore the code and modify the vocabulary or weights to deepen your understanding of how these concepts function in large-scale language models. By changing these parameters, you can observe how they affect the model's predictions.
